# Plugin Manager #
Plugin Manager is a plugin management system for Ruby On Rails.  It allows the Rails Application to internally enable or disable plugins (and their sub, features) without requiring a restart of the whole application.

## Installing ##

	$ git clone git://github.com/redjazz96/plugin-manager
